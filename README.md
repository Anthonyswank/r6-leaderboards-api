# R6-Leaderboards-API

## https://r6-leaderboards.vercel.app/

Welcome to the Back-end code of my first fullstack project, R6 Leaderboards!

This code pairs with my front-end code found here: 

## https://github.com/Anthonyswank/r6-leaderboards

This app is based on a game me and a group of buddies enjoy, pushing
our competitiveness to the next level. Being able to track and push
for the top of the leaderboard, this app will do that for you. I had alot
of fun developing this, and cant wait to add more to it in the future!

My API consists of being able to see all members currently added, as well as being able to add and delete those members from the leaderboard at any time.

Technology used in this project includes,

    - Javascript
    - React JS
    - Express
    - PostgreSQL
    - Mocha
    - Supertest
    - React testing library
